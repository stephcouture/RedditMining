# Script for Reddit data mining. This script will download datas from a given subreddit account, 
# and insert them into an sqlite database (reddit.sqlite).
#
# Arguments : RedditMining [Name of subreddit] [client_id] [client_secret] 
# Where [client_id] and [client_secret] can be found on your reddit account.
#
# The script will produce a database reddit.sqlite, that you can view (and manipulate with tools
# such as the SQLITEManager plugin in Firefox : https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/
